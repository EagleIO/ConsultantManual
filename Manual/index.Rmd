This is the student consultant handbook for members of Eagle I.O. Herein lie expectations, responsibilities, and strategy to keep Eagle I.O viable with future [Montclair State University I/O Psychology](https://www.montclair.edu/psychology/graduate-programs/industrial-organizational-psychology/) cohorts...


# Introduction

+ This is the consultant manual for Eagle I.O student consultants. It contains the              expectations, roles, and responsibilities of MSU student consultants who are members of Eagle I.O.
+ As of Spring semester 2020, the ongoing projects for Eagle I.O. include: 1) a mentorship program between the 1 year and 2nd year cohorts, 2) an engagement survey, and 3) this student consultant manual (which includes, for example, a succession plan to sustain and grow Eagle I.O)
+ Future aspirations are to have Eagle I.O. be a client-facing organization that can provide student-led solutions to external clients
